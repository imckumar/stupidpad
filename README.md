# 📝 StupidPad — Minimal Web Editor for LeetCoding & Learning

**Live site:** [https://imckumar.github.io/stupidpad/](https://imckumar.github.io/stupidpad/)

StupidPad is a no-frills, in-browser text editor built for fast, focused coding — especially useful when practicing on platforms like LeetCode or working through tutorials.

---

## 🚀 Why I Built This

Most online editors are either too bloated or too restrictive — especially when it comes to simple things like:
- **Indentation with TAB** (for JSON, Python, etc.)
- **Avoiding autocorrect/autosuggest**
- **Side-by-side panes** for learning and doing
- **Regex-based find & replace**

I couldn’t find one that just let me code the way I wanted — so I built **StupidPad**.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Supports `TAB` for indentation (JSON, CSS, Python, JS, etc.)
- ✅ **Comment-aware** editing (understands `//`, `#`, `/* */`)
- ✅ Add/remove **panes** for side-by-side learning/coding
- ✅ **Search / Replace / Regex Replace**
- ✅ **Diff two panes** to compare content
- ✅ Auto-saves to **your browser’s local storage**
- ✅ Works **offline** after initial load
- 🚫 No login, tracking, or cloud sync — **just code**

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML + CSS + JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Uses `localStorage` for data persistence

---

## 🧪 Use Cases

- Practice LeetCode problems without distractions
- Compare code snippets side-by-side
- Draft or test JSON, Python, CSS quickly
- Run quick search/replace using regex
- Note-taking while watching tutorials

---

## 📦 Future Plans

- [ ] Add dark mode
- [ ] Optional syntax highlighting
- [ ] Import/export text to files
- [ ] Keybindings for power users
